## Building A Music Recommender System
### Middlebury College, Computer Science CSCI 701 (Fall 2020)

### About our project
In this project, we present a comparative study of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models to establish the most suitable recommender system for the KKBox music preference dataset available on Kaggle as part of the WSDM - KKBox's Music Recommendation Challenge.

See the README in our [project repository](https://github.com/guanghanp/cs701-music-recommender-system) for information on building and using our software.
